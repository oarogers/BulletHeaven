A game made for Archtitecture Jam on Discord. I actually remade the game a bunch of times as I was learning more about software architecture. I eventually realized the game would take too long to finish trying to implement what I was learning, and I just scrapped what I had and tried to get everything together quickly, which ended up messier than I'd like. I learned a lot, but I don't think it shows in this project. Perhaps I'll have another go at it again someday.
